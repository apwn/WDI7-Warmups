# Warmups

Hello WDI7. Welcome to warmups!

Each morning, a warmup will be uploaded to this repository. At the end of the morning, a solution will be posted. This will occur 4 to 5 time a week, with the exception of project weeks.

These exercises are useful for two reasons:

1) They will get you in the zone for the onslaught of information that will be coming your way.
2) They are often used as interview questions.

Please **make sure you star or fork this repository** on your github account so you have access to it.

Best of luck!
