# BattleShip Front-End

Re-create index.html and style.css, with all the attached functionality/animations with JQuery.

1. Create a new folder called 'battleShips'.
2. Create an empty index.html with just a head and empty body.
3. Copy code.js to the new folder and link it to the html.
4. Re-create the original marked-up html and css with jQuery in code.js.


## Extension:
1. Make it a full game! Just:
2. Randomly generate three ships in the squares with Javascript.
3. Only display a ship if the player has found one; otherwise, just make the tile turn red.
4. When the player gets all three, declare them the winner by unhiding the div with id 'winner'.
